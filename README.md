# Home Automation System with ESP32, Sensors, React, and Firebase

Welcome to our Home Automation System repository! This project combines the power of ESP32 microcontrollers, various sensors, React for the frontend, and Firebase for the backend to create a robust and intelligent home automation solution.

## Features

- **ESP32 Microcontrollers**: Utilize ESP32 boards to control and monitor various aspects of your home environment.
- **Sensors**: Integrate sensors such as temperature, humidity, motion, and light sensors to gather real-time data about your home.
- **React Frontend**: Develop a user-friendly interface using React to interact with and control the home automation system.
- **Firebase Backend**: Leverage Firebase for real-time data storage, authentication, and backend functionalities.
- **Remote Control**: Access and control your home devices remotely through the internet.
- **Automation**: Set up automation routines and schedules based on sensor data or user-defined preferences.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Receive alerts and notifications via the frontend or mobile app for important events or system triggers.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home-automation-system.git

2. **Install Dependencies**:
- For ESP32: Install necessary libraries using the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
- For React Frontend: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm install`.
- Firebase: Set up Firebase project and configure Firebase SDKs.

3. **Configuration**:
- Configure ESP32 devices with your Wi-Fi credentials and Firebase connection details.
- Update frontend configurations such as Firebase credentials and API endpoints.

4. **Run the Application**:
- Flash the ESP32 devices with the appropriate firmware.
- Start the React frontend using `npm start` in the `frontend` directory.
- Ensure Firebase functions are deployed and running.

5. **Access the Application**:
- Open your browser and navigate to the React frontend's URL.
- Log in with your Firebase credentials to access the home automation dashboard.

## Usage

1. **Dashboard**: View real-time data from sensors, control connected devices, and manage automation settings from the dashboard.
2. **Device Control**: Toggle devices on/off, adjust settings, and monitor device statuses.
3. **Automation**: Set up automation rules based on sensor data, time schedules, or user-defined triggers.
4. **Alerts and Notifications**: Receive alerts for events such as security breaches, abnormal sensor readings, or scheduled tasks.
